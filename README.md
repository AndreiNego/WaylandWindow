run the ./build.sh script

run the executable ./build/WaylandWindow

expected outcome is a blue window with decorators on top (for KDE) with a functional close button.

In case of crash please run the executable with wayland debug flag and send me the last line(s) of the output ->

WAYLAND_DEBUG=1 ./build/WaylandWindow
